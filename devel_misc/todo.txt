    - in the package we should have visible only one Gini coefficient (we have to decide which one) and Gini_v. We can keep the other two hidden somewhere, and we could show them as an alternative if requested

I agree. You wrote to me that the Gini variant is 1-2*gini. Which Gini is this? We could take that Gini as a base and then also provide the Gini variant via the harmonize option in GetShape I'm about to implement.

    - add e-dagger in GetShape() output;

I thought about it and we shouldn't do this. In fact I will remove Variance from GetShape as well. Reason being that both measures are confounded by pace. They are not dimensionless, which is the defining characteristic of a shape measure. As we are implementing Annette's pace-shape methodology instead of building a lifetable-measures package, we should only provide true shape measures.

    - Entropy should return a value close to Gini coefficient (they have the same interpretation);

I will remove the re-scaling from the measures. We have to see then, if the values are ok.

    - I still want the input function that can accept as arguments: Dx & Ex or mx or qx or lx and return a pash object. There is a limited number of function human brain can remember and most of the spots are taken (in my case). That’s why I like packages with 5-10 functions maximum. We should make our package as simple and user friendly as possible.

I share your opinion on simplicity. We have to be careful to implement this without introducing additional confusion though. I'll think about it.

To do's:
- in the package we should have visible only one Gini coefficient (we have to decide which one) and Gini_v. We can keep the other two hidden somewhere, and we could show them as an alternative if requested.
- move mu_bar to pace measures;
- add e-dagger in GetShape() output;
- Entropy should return a value close to Gini coefficient (they have the same interpretation);
